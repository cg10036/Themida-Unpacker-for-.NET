# Themida Unpacker for .NET

## what is Themida Unpacker for .NET?

Themida Unpacker for .NET is a tool developed to quickly and easily unpack packed .NET files.

Support all version! (Tested in 1.x, 2.x, 3.x)

## Function

- bypass .NET based antidump (ConfuserEx etc...)

## How to use?

goto SuspendProcess/bin/Release/ folder

Just drag .NET file and select pd.exe! (32bit to 32bit, 64bit to 64bit)

pd.exe will dump file! if not, just manual dump with SCYLLA!!!!!

you have to install vbruntime and .NET runtime etc.... JUST INSTALL VISUAL STUDIO .NET, C++, Universal Windows Platform!!!!!! :)

## How it works?

Search DLLS, if "clrjit.dll" found, suspend process and dump.
